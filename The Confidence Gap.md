# The Confidence Gap, by Dr Russ Harris
## Summary
* This book is about how to build confidence, get out of your comfort zone, and not let your feelings control your actionsThe author is a therapist specialising in ACT therapy, and book is based on what he's found worked for patients in face-to-face therapy sessions
* The target audience is people with anxiety or seriously low self-esteem, but I'd say this is valuable to anyone who feels what they want to do (or feel like they should do) and what they actually do don't always align (e.g. due to procrastination, anxiety, low motivation).
* The central lesson of the book is that feelings follow actions, we won't feel confident about doing something until we've got experience doing it. The book rejects any "fake it til you make it" or positive-thinking strategies, and offers practical strategies for how to manage negative thoughts and emotions so it's not just a case of "grit your teeth and do it"
* 4/5, I'd recommend it to almost anyone, but the writing style may put some people off

## How Confidence Works
### The confidence gap
Two important components of feeling confident are skill and experience.
* It's impossible to feel confident about doing something if you're not actually good at it. If you suck at playing the guitar, you're never going to feel confident walking on stage to play in front of an audience
* It's also impossible to feel confident about doing something you've never done before, regardless of how good you are at it. Even if you're the best guitar player in the world, you won't feel confident about performing to an audience if you've never done it before

This causes a paradox ("the confidence gap") that keeps us stuck
* The problem is, most of us don't want to do things if we don't feel confident about them. We don't want to feel the anxiety and stress of doing something we're afraid of, or the pain and hurt of failure.
* We think we must wait around until we feel confident, or that we can boost our confidence with strategies like positive affirmations and self-help books
  * Important note: yes, this is a self-help book of sorts, but reading it won't fix your problems any more than reading a cookbook will make you a good cook. In order to gain confidence, you need to practise what the book teaches, regularly and over a long period of time. It takes time and effort
* But that's not how confidence works, we need to do the thing despite not yet having confidence with it -- that's the only way to gain confidence. Confidence must be earned through action.
* Once we realise that, the problem becomes about how to become OK with the "negative" thoughts and feelings that come with low confidence, and how to not let them control us
  * This doesn't mean we have to ignore or suppress our emotions, pretend we don't have them, or put up with feeling awful. Doing that will often only amplify the emotions and make the problem worse. This book teaches a lot of healthy ways to handle and accept your negative thoughts and emotions. 

Sounds stupid? Sounds too good to be true?
* The author encourages us to be sceptical, but continue anyway. Notice your reactions, make space for sceptical thoughts and feelings, but keep reading anyway
* Often, the truth is unintuitive or goes against what we've been taught all our lives. For example, it's very hard to understand and believe the benefits of meditation until you've tried it.

### What is confidence?
* Confidence is both a feeling and an action
  * Feelings of confidence means a sense of being calm and at ease.
  * Acts of confidence means an act of trust.
* It's important to realise that we can perform acts of confidence even if we don't have feelings of confidence.
  * For example, if you're getting brain surgery done by a world-class surgeon, you'll probably feel anxious (not confident), but you're still doing an act of confidence by trusting the surgeon.
  * So confidence does not mean an absence of fear -- you can feel afraid, and still be confident
* Often, by performing acts of confidence, we'll gain feelings of confidence -- but this isn't guaranteed. Some life-long stage performers still feel fear every time they step on stage.
  * Even if the feelings of confidence never arrive, we can take comfort in the knowledge that we're still doing the thing we want to do. A performer who can manage their stage-fright well can still achieve their dreams of becoming a superstar.

### The confidence cycle
So in summary, to gain confidence, we need to put in work and effort to develop our skills, and also apply these skills outside of our comfort zone.
It's an iterative process that looks roughly like this
1. Practise a skill (e.g. playing the guitar).
   *This takes consistency, patience and dedication
3. Apply it effectively outside your comfort zone. (e.g. playing to a small audience).
   * It's important to stay present and focused on the task, rather than getting distracted by thoughts and emotions 
5. Assess the results non-judgmentally
   * It's important to be non-judgemental here, to assess objectively what worked and what didn't, without getting caught up in positive or negative thoughts and feelings about it
7. Modify as needed.
   * Repeat the process with the lessons you learned from step 3

## Managing your thoughts and feelings
The way confidence works might look obvious now. And it might also feel totally unhelpful. If it was as simple as "just do it anyway", no one would ever need to pick up a book like this.
The hardest part of gaining confidence is learning to manage the negative thoughts and feelings that come with getting outside your comfort zone.

### Thoughts and feelings aren't inherently bad
* Negative thoughts and feelings are an avoidable part of life and they happen to everyone. We're brought up to believe that they're bad, that we shouldn't have them, and that if we do have them we need to get rid of them.
  * Fear is a normal, natural part of life that everyone experiences. It will always happen when you step outside your comfort zone (that's how you know you're outside your comfort zone). People might use different words for it, like being anxious, stressed, nerves, self-doubt, cold feet, wired. These are all flavours of fear, but it can be hard to admit to ourselves that's what we're feeling
* They're only a problem if we get too caught up in, like if we get stuck in our own head, ruminating on our fears and failures, or if we become so obsessed with avoiding them that it controls our lives
  * We're brought up to believe that fear is a bad thing, and we should try to avoid feeling fear. We believe that if we're feeling fear, we must take action to get rid of the fear. But this simply isn't true -- fear in itself isn't a bad thing, if we can deal with it in a healthy way
  * Fear can be useful, if we can harness it correctly. It's a great source of energy.
* If we can make space to have these negative thoughts and feelings, to non-judgmentally accept them as part of our lives, and if we can avoid getting caught up in them, then we'll be better off.
  * We can't get rid of these thoughts and feelings, no matter how hard we try or what we do. Fighting against them will often only make them worse

### When do thoughts and feelings become a problem?
Problematic thoughts
* We can "get hooked" on thoughts, or "fused", where we become one with the thought. Instead of seeing the thought for what it is (words and images inside our head), it becomes a fact, a truth, something we must act on and obey.
* One type of thought that hooks us is thoughts that seem like reasons. There are 4 kinds of reason-giving-thoughts
  * Obstacles (e.g. I don't have the time)
  * Self-judgements (e.g. I'm not good enough at this)
  * Comparisons (e.g. I'm not as good as them)
  * Predictions (e.g. I'll fail)
* In all these cases, these thoughts can serve a useful purpose, or they can be destructive.
  * Realistically assessing obstacles, your own abilities and possible outcomes all help you perform better, as long as you don't get so caught up in the negative that you give up. So does seeing how other people succeed, as long as you can do it without feeling like a failure.
* But if we see these things as reasons to give up and not try, as something to beat ourselves up about, or we get so distracted by them that we can't perform well, then they become a problem
* To tell if your thoughts are a problem or not, ask yourself: is acting on this thought going to lead me to the type of life I want? Is this thought useful to me? This is called "workability"

Problematic emotions
* Emotions like fear and anger are a normal, healthy part of life. There's nothing wrong with them inherently
* When emotions start to control our actions for us, this becomes a problem.
* When we feel unpleasant emotions, most of us reason in one of these ways:
  * Autopilot: acting out on the emotion, e.g. lashing out in anger, withdrawing in fear.
    * This is a problem because it leaves us less control over ourselves and our lives.
  * Avoiding feelings
    * We distract ourselves (e.g. with TV, socializing, work). This leave ourselves with less time and energy to do the things that matter
    * We avoid things that cause the feeling (quit, procrastinate, withdraw). This makes our life smaller, and means we miss opportunities
    * We use thinking strategies (blame others, analysing why, denial, positive affirmations, treating it as a problem to be solved, beating ourselves up). This means we get wrapped up in our own head rather than staying present, and some thinking strategies have other damaging consequences
    * We use substances to change our feelings (food, alcohol, caffeine, drugs). This damages our health
* Avoidance strategies don't work, and usually cause the feelings to grow bigger, and their control over us to grow more powerful
  * In exposure therapy for phobias, fear is treated by gradually increasing exposure to the object of fear, so the person learns there's nothing to fear. For negative feelings, it's the same. We need to experience them to reduce their power over us

### What to do when they are a problem
Unhooking yourself. 

Essentially, to get unhooked, you need to become aware of when it's happening, and put distance between yourself and the thing that's hooked you. This takes time and practice. Meditation is a great way to build this skill.
* Notice you're hooked
* Name it
 * Say to yourself, "oops, just got hooked", or "I'm noticing fear"
* Neutralise it (make it harmless)
  * For thoughts: Putting distance between yourself and the thought can help. You can do this by framing it as a thought or feeling like "I'm having the thought that X", or singing the thought to a silly tune or saying it mentally in a silly voice can help. The goal is to realise that the thought is just words and images in your head, nothing more. It's nothing to cling to or run from
  * For feelings, make space for the feeling. Notice with curiosity and openness how it feels. Accept the feeling and let it do its things. If you can, welcome and befriend it. You don't have to want it or like it, but you're not trying to get rid of it.
* Expand awareness: bring your attention back to the present moment, to external sights and sounds.
  * You'll still have the thoughts chattering away in your head, or still have the feelings. The goal isn't to stop them or get rid of them (that's impossible), the goal is to be present despite them.

Note: these steps only work if you genuinely go into it with the attitude of accepting your feelings, not changing or getting rid of them. Your intention must be right. Be aware of:
* Sometimes when you do this, the feeling will disappear, but don't come to expect this or try to use this technique for this purpose
* Sometimes when accepting a feeling, you'll get hooked on unhelpful thoughts (like, I hate this feeling). You can't stop these thoughts from happening, but when they do, unhook yourself
* Tolerance (I can put up with this feeling) is different to acceptance (I allow this feeling). It's in the right direction, but it's not what we're aiming for. You shouldn't feel like you're gritting your teeth to put up with it.
* Remember why you're doing this, it's so you can live according to your values

### Why mindfulness matters
Unhooking ourselves helps us stay present and fully engaged in the current moment, which is hugely beneficial for 2 reasons
* It helps us perform better.
  * If you want to hit a home run, you need all your attention on the ball, not thinking about how what happened last swing, what'll happen after the game, or if you're any good at this
* If you want to be a good conversationalist, you need to keep your attention on the conversation, not worrying about the fact you don't know what to say or what the other person thinks of you
  * It helps us enjoy life more
  * Everything is more enjoyable if you're fully engaged in it. Sports and conversations and even a cup of tea are all more enjoyable if you're present rather than in your own head.

Similarly, mindfulness can help us perform better and enjoy things more. Mindfulness means paying attention in a way that's open, curious and flexible
* Open = we're open to what's happen even if we don't like it, we're not turning away or avoiding it
* Flexible = not hyper-focused on one aspect, taking it all in
* Curious = seeking to discover something new in the experience. We can even be curious about something as repetitive as breathing, no 2 breaths are exactly alike

## Other mental traps
### Self-acceptance, not self-esteem
* Successful people often have fragile self-esteem. When they're achieving well, they feel like a winner, but as soon as they fail, their self-esteem vanishes.
* High self-esteem (believing positive judgements about yourself) isn't actually good for you. People with high self-esteem don't perform better, aren't more charismatic, are worse at taking feedback, etc.
* Self-acceptance is more important than self-esteem
  * Self-acceptance = letting go of self-judgements, accepting everyone fails sometimes
  * Self-acceptance means being able to neutrally evaluate aspects of our performance, without getting caught up in unhelpful thoughts like "I'm so crap at this"
  * Just like getting unhooked, if you notice self-judgements, even positive ones, notice and name ("judgement") and neutralize them

### The motivation trap
* It's impossible to have no motivation, whatever we're doing always serves some purpose.
  * Often when we say we have no motivation to do X, we mean we have a desire to do X (which is important and meaningful to us), but our desire to avoid discomfort is stronger.
  * E.g. if we're lying on the couch rather than working out, we don't "have no motivation to work out", rather "our desire to relax and avoid the discomfort of exercise is winning over out desire to be fit and healthy, look good, and take care of our body"
  * By phrasing it this way, we can clearly assess our competing desires and make better choices.
* When people say they don't have any motivation, they often mean, "I have a desire to do it and it's important to me, but unless I feel good, happy, energized and inspired, I'm not going to do it"
* Motivation is just the desire to do something, not some magic force that gives us the power to do it. Don't get focused on chasing it.
* Same with discipline and willpower. These aren't magic forces, and aren't feelings we can wait around and acquire -- but if we consistently act in a committed, value-driven way, we'll start to feel like we have discipline and willpower.
* When people say they're lacking motivation, they often mean they're lacking commitment, they aren't willing to do what's required.
* If we believe motivation is a feeling, we get trapped in waiting to feel motivated before we act. Similar to confidence, committed action comes first, feeling motivated comes after
* The way you feel is outside your control, but the action you take is within your control.
* Feelings follow actions, usually. But even if they don't, we still get the satisfaction of knowing we're doing the action we wanted to.
* If you find yourself saying you're "unmotivated", unhook yourself, and ask yourself what's really driving your behaviour. Are you seeking short-term comfort over something more meaningful and enriching?

### Getting over failure
* Failing feels bad, but it's a normal, essential part of life. The more we can not failure hold us back, the more successful we will be
  * "Sucking at something is the first step to being kinda good at something", "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career... I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."
* To become OK with failing:
  * Remind yourself it's a normal fact of life, and many successful people have failed.
  * Give yourself permission to fail, to suck, to produce crap. The first draft of a novel is often called the "vomit draft"
  * View failure as honest feedback. It lets us know when what we're doing isn't working
  * Redefine success as "living by your values". If your goal is publishing a book, it's easy to fail, but if your goal is develop your skills and express your creativity, then every unpublished book is still a success
* To rebound from failure
  * Unhook yourself and make room for your feelings
  * be kind to yourself, talk to yourself like you would a friend. Not overly negative (you're a loser) or overly positive (no use crying over spilt milk), just compassionate (I know it hurts like hell when this stuff happens, but I'm here for you)
  * Appreciate what worked, what did you do better than last time?
  * Find something useful, something to learn from
  * Get in touch with your values, particularly values like persistence, personal growth, adaptability, courage, and creativity. Take pride in living by these values

## Values-driven living
Be clear on why you're doing this
This is going to be hard, and going to take time, and it's going to involve going through some unpleasant emotions. If you lose sight of why you're doing this, it will be tempting to give up.

### Think about your goals
* The author encourages you to take some time to consider what you would want to be different if you had more confidence. This could be achieving some career or personal goals, improving relationships, performing better under stress, etc
  * How would you be different? Behave differently? How would others view and treat you differently? How would your life change?

### But more importantly, think about your values
* When on a long, hard road to a goal you might never achieve, it can be helpful to take a value-centred approach rather than a goal-centred approach
  * A goal is a desired outcome, like winning the race, getting your dream job, or making a new friend. It's something you achieve, and then it's done, and it's not always in your control if you achieve it or not
  * A value is a way of being, like running to the best of your ability, being fully engaged in your work, or being open and friendly towards others. There's no end state, and regardless of luck and external circumstances, you can always live by your values
* Living by your values will move you closer to your goal, but they also provide a sense of meaning and fulfilment along the way. And because whether you succeed or fail at living by your values is fully in your control, you can always choose to do this, whatever your external circumstances
  * For example, a prisoner in a jail can still choose to live by their values and find satisfaction in that, even if they can control very little about their life and outcomes.
  * If you're focused on the goal of running the race in a certain time, then you're likely to come away disappointed and frustrated and feeling like months of training was wasted. But if you're focused on the values of being fit and healthy, improving yourself, and doing your best, then you'll find satisfaction whatever the outcome.
* The author encourages you to take time to reflect on your values. This doesn't have to be a limited or fixed list, but that can be a good starting point.
  * For goals you want to achieve, consider what values you might hold that support those. Some useful values are persistence, courage, self-development, creativity
  * Your goals and values should be in sync with each other and support each other. Whatever your goal, if it's important to you, should should be able to figure out some values that support it
