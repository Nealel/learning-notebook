# learning-notebook
This repo is a collection of personal learning notes taken from books, courses and conferences, as well as some "knowledge share" presentations I've run.

Note: the format of the notes reflects the format of note-taking I was using at the time I made them. Some don't render natively in github currently, and need to be downloaded to be read
