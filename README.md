# learning-notebook
This repo is a collection of personal learning notes taken from books, courses and conferences, as well as some "knowledge share" presentations I've run.

Note: the format of the notes reflects the format of note-taking I was using at the time I made them. Some don't render natively in github currently, and need to be downloaded to be read

## My Notes

### Non-technical books
"Soft" skills for managers, but still very relevant for individual contributors 
* [Crucial Conversations](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/Crucial%20conversations%20book.pdf): amazing guide for navigating tough conversations successfully
* [Essentialism](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/Essentialism%20book.pdf): how to focus on what really matters
* [Resillient Management](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/Resilient%20Management%20book.pdf): great guide for first-time managers

### Technical knowledge shares
Mostly aimed at junior developers, mostly designed to fit in in one hour including interactive Q&A
* [Code Efficiency](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/Code%20Efficiency%20for%20Juniors%20Knowledge%20share.pdf)
* [Command Line](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/Command%20line%20for%20Juniors%20Knowledge%20share.pdf)
* [Vim](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/vim%20knowledge%20share.pdf)
* [Concurrency](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/Concurrency%20knowledge%20share.pdf)

### Conferences and courses
Messier notes taken in real-time, but still useful to reference occassionally. 
* [Women in Tech Conference](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/Women%20in%20tech%20conference%20notes.pdf)
* [Delegation training](https://github.com/Nealel/learning-notebook/blob/main/delegation%20training.pdf)
