# Essentialism by Greg McKeown

Summary



* Essentialism is a book about managing time, energy and resources effectively, and prioritising what's really important.
* This book is mostly about shifting your mindset to be more radical and ruthless about prioritising, but it does provide some practical advice for how to get there.
* 4/5, I'd recommend it to people specifically looking to get better at prioritisation and time management, but not to everyone. It's a bit long-winded, and there's not really any _new _info, but reading it did help me think about my problems differently

Why is doing less better?



* It's better to make a significant amount of progress on one very important thing than tiny amounts of progress on many kind-of-important things things.
* You only have so many hours in a day (and so many days in your life), you will _never _get to the end of your to-do list, never get everything done. Don't be tricked into feeling like you can get everything done, this will lead you to prioritise the wrong things. If you don't make intentional trade-offs, external forces will make them for you (and will make trade-offs in a way you'd never choose to do intentionally). Better to acknowledge the limitation and make and active choice
* Spreading yourself too thin can contribute to burnout. You always feel busy, but never feel like you're making progress. Focusing on doing a few things well means you feel less busy, and feel like you're making more progress.
* Spreading yourself thin leads to poor results. Things get done late or badly. We often say yes to doing more than we can handle to try to please people, but if we don't have the capacity to deliver on our promises, we end up disappointing people anyway

The paradox of success



* The paradox of success is 4 steps
    * We start with clear purpose, so we succeed
    * Success brings increased opportunities
    * We pursue more opportunities and lose clarity of purpose
    * We become distracted from what's important, so we fail
* This applies at the level of companies
    * Start-ups have few resources and hyper-focus on a clear goal, and ruthlessly cut anything that doesn't move the needle. Then they get more money, hire more people, and start more projects.  They try to do too many things that don't matter, or do so many things they deliver poor results. This is a common reason for big business to fail
* And it applies at the level of individuals
    * An engineer joins a company and is given a single, clear project. They deliver well, and get a reputation for getting things done. People come to them with many requests, and their to-do list grows, their efforts are split in many different directions. They are too distracted to get anything done

Why is it hard to do less but better?



* We're faced with too many choices on a daily basis, and get decision fatigue
* We experience social pressure to say yes to requests. Saying no is awkward, we want to please others, and sometimes we fear repercussions for saying no.
* We ignore reality, and falsely believe we can do it all. We think that by not _intentionally_ making trade-offs, we can avoid making them at all.
* We feel fear of missing out, a nagging feeling of what-if every time we say no.

The core essentialist mindset



* We can choose how we spend our time. You don't have to do anything
    * "I don't have to, I chose too"
* Almost everything is noise, only a few things are really important
    * "You can't under-estimate the importance of almost everything"
    * Different activities have different rates of return, some have 10x, 100x, 1000x the rate of return of others. Don't waste your time on things with low returns
* We can't do it all. Trade-offs are inevitable.
    * It's not a question of how we can do it all, it's a question of who chooses what we do and don't do.
    * "I can do anything, but I can't do everything"

You do have a choice



* We have way more choice than we are usually willing to admit to ourselves. I could quit my job, move to another country and become a train-hopping bum. Staying in my current job, my current country is all a choice, and I know that rationally, but emotionally it doesn't feel like a choice
    * Sometimes our choices are constrained though. I can't chose what my options are, but I can chose among those options.
    * But other times, it's learned helplessness. We learned growing up that there were certain constraints in life; as an adult, we still act as if those constraints are there long after they're gone.
    * We often let defaults guide us and act on auto-pilot. But by choosing to do the default, you're still choosing (just subconsciously)
* Choosing something to "keep your options open" is a trap. Having more options doesn't help if you don't like any of them. Better to commit to the one thing you want rather than straddling multiple options ineffectively
* Choosing is hard, because it means giving something up. 

How to practise essentialism



* There are 3 steps, but really, it's just like cleaning out your closet
* Evaluate: figure out what your priorities are, and be ruthless
    * Like going through your closet and making a big pile of "get rid of" and a small pile of "keep". Be ruthless, not "will I maybe wear this one day", but "does it spark joy". Not "is this useful to do?" but "is this the most important thing I could be doing"
* Eliminate: stop doing the non-essential activities
    * Have a plan for how to gracefully stop doing these things. This is like taking your clothes to the donation bin
* Execute: actually do the things that are important, and have the discipline to keep from back-sliding
    * This is a daily habit, like cleaning your closet

Tools for figuring out what's important



* Make time and space to focus
    * It takes distraction-free time to figure out what matters. Schedule this in your calendar (e.g. 4x30m a day, or 1 day a month), and also make sure your physical space supports this kind of work (distraction free, silence notifications, go for a walk)
    * Reading can help stimulate novel thoughts, so make time for that in your routine
    * This time isn't about hyper-focusing on one question, it's about exploring 100s of possibilities
* Gather information, and go beyond the fact to figure out why it matters. The quality of your decision making is only as good as the quality of your information
    * Journal a little every day, just a few lines until it becomes a habit. A journal is an external hard-drive for your brain. Every few months, reread it to identify patterns.
    * Look for what other people missed, or the details that surprise you
    * Talk to primary sources, don't get your info second-hand
    * Clarify the question, what's your goal, what are you trying to answer?
* Play: do things for the joy of doing them
    * It broadens our options, and helps us see possibilities we wouldn't have seen otherwise
    * It lowers stress, which helps us think more clearly, and also improves executive brain function
    * How? bring play-based activities into work. Create an environment around you that encourages play. Revisit the things you did for play as a child,
* Self-care: take care of your greatest asset, yourself
    * Get enough sleep, take care of your physical and mental health, and avoid burnout.
    * Skimping on sleep gives us more hours in the day, but worse quality hours. We'll perform better if we sleep well and work less, rather than work more at the expense of sleep.
* Be ruthlessly selective: if it's not "hell yes," then its a no
    * There are many opportunities that are "good enough", but these bring clutter into our lives and leave less space for what matters. I'd rather have a small number of clothes I love than a closet full of things that are OK
    * How? Make your "hell yes" criteria Selevtive, Explicit and Right. When an opportunity comes along, write down 3 minimum criteria it must meet, and 2 very selective ones. It must meet 3/3 minimum criteria and 2/3 selective ones

Clarify your purpose



* Having a clear purpose empowers you/everyone on the team to say no when something's not serving that purpose. This one decision makes every other decision easier.
* When we don't have a clear purpose, our efforts aren't aligned, so we go nowhere.
    * This is true on a team level (different people working on different things), or an individual level (spreading your own efforts thin)
    * If our purpose isn't clear, we do things because it "seems we should", e.g. it will make us look good to our boss or friends, or it's what others are doing.
    * This can become destructive, e.g. office politics aimed at looking good rather than getting stuff done; getting into debt to buy a nice car to look wealthy
* You need a _really clear _purpose (not just kind of clear). Take time to craft one.
    * Don't worry about word-smithing, focus on the content of the purpose rather than the words.
    * Ask yourself: if you could be truly excellent at only one thing, what would it be? And how will you know when you're done?
    * A purpose must be _MEASURABLE _(objective) and _MEANINGFUL _(inspiring). 
        * "Decrease churn by 5% this quarter" is measurable, but not meaningful. No one cares.
        * "End world hunger" is meaningful but not measurable. It's too vague.
        * "Get everyone in the UK online by 2012" is both measurable and meaningful.

How to say no gracefully



* First, you need courage in your convictions. You need the clear purpose to know why you are saying no. Social pressure can create emotions that cause us to lose clarity.
    * Focus on the trade-off. What are you giving up by saying yes?
* If you say no gracefully, you'll win respect rather than resentment. There might be hurt emotions at first, but in the end, people will respect you more for it.
    * Giving a clear no is often more appreciated than a non-committal yes.
* Some tips on how
    * Don't respond immediately, take time to think -- "Let me check and get back to you"
    * Make the trade-off an open discussion -- "Yes, what should I deprioritize?"
    * Delegate or offer alternatives -- "I can't do it, but maybe X would be interested"
    * Make no the default -- automated out-of-office emails
    * "You're welcome to X, I'm willing to Y"
    * Use other words -- "I don't have the bandwidth"

Cognitive biases that make it hard to give something up,k and how to address them



* Sunk cost bias is powerful, even if we're aware of it, and can keep us doing things which aren't valuable. Admitting failure is painful, but a necessary step to success.
    * Focus on the trade-off you're making: what else could you do with your time/effort/resources?
* Endowment effect: we value things we already own more than things we don't. When we feel like we own an activity, it's harder to uncommit
    * Pretend you don't have it yet, and ask what would you be willing to give up to get it?
* Status quo bias: it's easy to keep doing something just because we've always done it. Often, we don't even question it.
    * Use zero-based budgeting: assume you have no existing commitments, what do you add back in?
* Our immediate response is often a casual yes. It's how we're brought up, no one ever teaches us to say no
    * Take a pause to think before responding. Take a breath, or say you'll get back to them
* Fear of missing out
    * Trial it out, remove it and see if there are any negative consequences
* In general, get a neutral second opinion

Create buffer time



* People suck at estimating. We under-estimate how much time/work something will take, so we over-commit, and end up overstretched when the reality is things take longer than we thought they would. We cut corners, do poor quality work and miss deadlines.
* If we build buffer time into our planning, then either we're prepared when something takes longer than we thought, or we end up with some nice extra time. We can spend this extra time creating more buffer for when things go wrong, like paying down tech debt now so we can move more quickly on the next project
* Add 50% to all your estimates. Collect estimates anonymously (people are much better estimating anonymously)

Some other tips



* Address bottlenecks: In many cases, the most important thing you can do is address the bottleneck. Find the thing that's currently constraining the rate of progress and work on improving that. Making a faster car won't help if the roads are congested
    * The bottleneck isn't always the biggest or most obvious problem.
* Celebrate small wins: Don't try to accomplish everything all at once, start with small, meaningful wins
    * Look for the "minimum viable progress", the smallest amount of progress that would be useful and valuable
    * The feeling of progress is a great motivator. Making your progress visible might seem silly, but can be powerful
* Leverage defaults: routines and habits are powerful. Most of what we do in a day is done on autopilot, so getting these right will put on the path to success or failure
    * Only try to fix one habit at a time, don't change everything at once
    * Habits are made of a cue, routine, and reward. Leverage or repurpose your existing cues (e.g. when X happens, then I will Y)
* Boundaries are empowering: boundaries help us pro-actively eliminate distractions and say no. Let other people have their own problems without making them your problems too
* Decision fatigue
